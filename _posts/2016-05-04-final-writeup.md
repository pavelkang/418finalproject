# Summary

We have implemented and optimized a parallel collaborative filtering engine which features:

- A __compact data structure and related algorithms__ that we invented (we have __not__ read about any data compression work in collaborative filtering papers)
- A __multi-GPU__, matrix-based solution
- __Parallel locality sensitive hashing__ preprocessing algorithm for user clustering

Our deliverables will include:

- Performance graph of multiple algorithms we have implemented.


# Background and Approach
